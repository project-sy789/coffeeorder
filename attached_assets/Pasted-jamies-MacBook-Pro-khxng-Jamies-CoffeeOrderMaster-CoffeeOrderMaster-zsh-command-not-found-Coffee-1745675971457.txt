(optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project subyai-92750 (Subyai)

=== Functions Setup

Detected existing codebase(s): default

? Would you like to initialize a new codebase, or overwrite an existing one? Initialize
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

? What should be the name of this codebase? coffeeordermaster
? In what sub-directory would you like to initialize your functions for codebase coffeeordermaster? coffeeordermaster
? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript
? Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
? File coffeeordermaster/package.json already exists. Overwrite? Yes
✔  Wrote coffeeordermaster/package.json
✔  Wrote coffeeordermaster/.eslintrc.js
✔  Wrote coffeeordermaster/index.js
✔  Wrote coffeeordermaster/.gitignore
? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.13.0: Use @eslint/config-array instead
npm warn deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? public
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
? File public/index.html already exists. Overwrite? Yes
